## Hi I'm Jaiden ðŸ‘‹

Always learning something new!

- Building tools for myself. Sometimes other people [find them useful](https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/1h6v4ks/check_how_busy_the_libraries_on_campus_are/) too.
- Knowledge should be open â€” my course notes are public on [GitHub](https://github.com/JaidenRatti/university-notes) and my [site](https://www.jaidenratti.com/Notes/). ($\LaTeX$ enjoyer)

Exp: full-stack, data (sci | eng), mobile, pm
